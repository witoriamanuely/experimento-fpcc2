Efforts to construct an artificial intelligence have relied on
ever more complex and carefully prepared programs.  While useful in
themselves, these programs
are unlikely to be useful in situations where ephemeral and
low value knowledge must be acquired.  For example a person (or robot)
working in a normal domestic environment knows a lot about which
cupboards have sticky doors and where the marmalade is kept.  It seems
unlikely that it will ever be economic to program such knowledge 
whether this be via a language or a discourse with an expert system.

It is my thesis, then, that any flexible robot system working in the
real world must contain a component of control intermediate
between hard wired 'reflex' responses and complex intellectual 
reasoning.  Such an intermediate system must be adaptive, be able
to carry out complex patte
